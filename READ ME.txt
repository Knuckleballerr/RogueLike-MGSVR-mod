This code is specifically designed for use with the RetroArch emulator.

Upon execution, the program will prompt you for a PID (Process ID) number, 
which can be located in the Task Manager under the "Details" tab.

Should you encounter issues with weapons or ammunition not being displayed, 
it may be due to incorrect memory addresses. In such cases, we recommend using Cosmos Advanced (int16) 
rather than Cheat Engine for address discovery.

Please note that this software has been tested exclusively on the Japanese version of Metal Gear Solid.

It's important to be aware that the executable file may be flagged by antivirus programs as a Trojan 
due to its interaction with system memory. Rest assured, this is a false positive. 
However, for your peace of mind, I encourage you to review the provided source code in PyCharm.

More updates soon.
